<h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>For the sushi-su</h3>

   <ul><li>120ml rice vinegar or brown rice vinegar</li>
        <li>3 tbsp sugar seasoning, to taste (optional)</li>
    </ul><ul>
    <h3>For the rice</h3>
        <li>450 Japanese rice (3 Japanese cups</li>

</ul>

<h2>Method</h2>
   <ol>
       <li>First wash the rice thoroughly in a sieve for 4 minutes, genty turning it over by hand until the water runs clear.</li> 
       <li>Drain the rice and put it in a pan with 540ml water.</li>
       <li>Leave to stand for a minimum of 30 minutes. (For best results leave for between 30 minutes to 1 hour.).</li>
       <li>Leave the soaking water in the pan with the rice and bring to the boil.</li>
       <li>Put the lid on, reduce the heat and simmer for 8-9 minutes.</li>
       <li>Turn the heat off and let it stand with the lid on for a further 5 minutes.</li>
       <li>Do not lift lhe lid.</li>
       <li>While the rice is cooking, to make the sushi-su, put the rice vinegar, sugar and 1 tbsp salt into a pan and leave on 
           a low heat until the sugar and salt have dissolved. Be careful not to let it boil or the flavour will spoil. Remove from
            head and leave to cool.</li>
        <li>Put the rice into a wide flat dish such as a sushi oke, a baking dish or a roasting tray. Pour the sushi-su over teh rice and fold
            it carefully not to damage the grains. You can use a fan or a hairdtyer on teh coolest setting to speed up the cooling process, 
            directing it at the rice. The suchi-su gives the rice more flavour and that familiar sticky glazed look.</li>
        <li>If  you don't want to use the rice immediately, cover it with a damp cloth so that it doesn't dry out. Leave in a 
            cool place, but do not regrigerate. The fridge will make the rice hard and dry, and the sushi-su helps to preserve the rice without 
            refrigeration. Will keep for a day.</li>
