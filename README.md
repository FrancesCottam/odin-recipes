# odin-recipes
My first Project
The readme is not intended for anyone else to read but will be a record of my own progress for myself!
Excited to get started on my first project. By the end of it I will have:
Become more familiar with HTML and be confident about creating a basic website. I will be able to use the basic template and add tags and attributes to organise the content in a legible way.

To recap without looking before I get started:
<!DOCTYPE>
<html>
<head><title>Odin-Recipes</title>
<meta charset="utf-8">

<body><p> My Odin Recipes

<strong>bold</strong>
"em"= emphasis

<img> for adding images which should also have <alt>this is an image of a tasty piece of chicken</alt>

<a href>
for adding links

I will aslo use <h1> etc to create headings as well as <ol> and <ul>  items in the list <li>
I will be more familiar with the project process as well as how to commit to Github in the appropriate way.
I believe I will be able to look back at this readme and see how much I have learned since 01.01.2022

There is a lot that I know but can't recall right now but this will come back to me as I work through this project. Thank you!
